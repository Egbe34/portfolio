 # 🌍 Air Quality & Health Impact Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes the impact of air pollution on public health, focusing on respiratory diseases. Using real-world data, we explore how pollutants like **PM2.5, NO₂, and CO** correlate with health issues such as asthma, lung infections, and other respiratory illnesses. 

## 🎯 Objectives
✅ Understand the relationship between air quality and public health.  
✅ Identify key pollutants affecting respiratory diseases.  
✅ Use **data visualization** to reveal trends and insights.  
✅ Provide policy recommendations for mitigating health risks.  

## 📊 Data & Methodology
- **Data Sources:** Real-world datasets on air pollution and health statistics.  
- **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau, Kaggle.  
- **Analysis Performed:**
  - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
  - Visualization of trends & correlations.
  - Interpretation of health impacts.

## 📈 Key Insights
🔹 High **PM2.5 & NO₂ levels** strongly correlate with increased respiratory disease cases.  
🔹 Urban areas with high traffic emissions show **higher pollution & health risks**.  
🔹 Seasonal trends indicate that air quality worsens in winter, impacting vulnerable populations.  
🔹 Public transport & green energy adoption can **reduce pollution and improve health outcomes**.  

## 🔎 Visualizations
📌 Interactive dashboards & visualizations are available on **Kaggle & Tableau**:
👉 **[Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/graceegbe12/air-quality-health-impact-analysis)**  
👉 Tableau Dashboard (Add Link If Available)  

## 💡 Business Impact & Recommendations
✔️ **Governments & policymakers** should implement **stricter air quality regulations**.  
✔️ **Urban planners** should increase **green spaces & promote public transport**.  
✔️ **Health organizations** should target **at-risk communities** with awareness campaigns.  
✔️ Further research should focus on **real-time pollution monitoring** for predictive analysis.
